# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping to work local?

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 	Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	- sometimes you don't agree with the content on the online repository

	- sometimes faulty content might be automatically included in your local repository which you don't want
  
# Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of the other? 

	- forks, when I want to make a copy of an existing repository and make adaptations to it 
	- clones, when I want to make a copy to my local computer and make changes to it
	- branches, when I want to make changes that are not present in the master branch and that can possibly break

# What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	- when you pull, i.e. fetch and merge, you can perform a fast forward merge, which means that you don't actually merge anything because the information is already contained within the merge!
